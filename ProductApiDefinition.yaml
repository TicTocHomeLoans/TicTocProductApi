    [Tic:Toc Enterprise](https://tictoc.ai) provides our platform partners with an easy way to access your product information.
      
    To get access to this API please contact your [account manager](mailto:enterprise@tictoc.ai).
      
    ## Getting Started  
    
    Integrating the Product API is easy. You'll need the following:
      - your test API client credentials. These will be provided to you by Tic:Toc, and must be stored securely
      - start developing using our test environment. This will allow you to get familiar with the request and response models through this documentation or embedded in your own customer experiences
      - your production API client credentials. These will be provided to you by Tic:Toc, and must be stored securely
      - go live!
      
    
    ## The API Orchestration
    
    To get API is structured as follows:
      - authenticate: first you must get a [`token`](#/token) to allow all calls to be authenticated
      - get a list of product: get a list of product codes using optional filters from [`/product/rate/getlist`](#/product/rate/getlist). All calls must include a [`token`](#/token) and the `x-api-key` header.
      - get product details: once you have your target product codes, then call the [`/product/rate/get`](#/product/rate/get) endpoint to get detailed product information such as rates, periods, repayment types and fees. All calls must include a [`token`](#/token) and the `x-api-key` header.
       
    You can also download a [Postman Collection](https://github.com/TicTocHomeLoans/XAIValidateApiPublic/raw/main/XAI%20Validate%20API%20Collection.postman_collection.json) to help you interact with the Product API.

      summary: Retrieve OAuth2 token using client credentials.

      description: >-
        Before you can call the XAI Validate endpoints, you need to authenticate via the `/token` API. Successful authentication will return a token that can then be used to authorise your access to functional APIs. You'll need to include this token in the `Authorization` header in your calls.
          
        The `/token` API URL includes values in the query path. The URL will look like this:        
          `https://{host}/oauth2/token?grant_type=client_credentials`

        The `host` value will either be `auth.tictoc.ai` for production or `auth.stage.tictoc.ai` for testing.

        You'll also need to include information in your headers:
          - `Authorization`: Base64 encoded `client_id` and `client_secret` provided to you by the XAI Validate team as part of onboarding. The format is: `"Basic {client_id}:{client_secret}"`
          - `Content-Type`: the value is `"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`

        **Remember, your API credentials must be kept safe and secure. Do not share these or publish to publicly accessible locations such as your client-side code or GitHub.**
